## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2.  Install the QuantumCalc package and its dependencies using pip:

     `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
3.  Download the repository to your machine.
4. Navigate to the directory using the command line.
5. Run the command:
`python setup.py install`

## Configuration

QuantumCalc does not require extensive configuration. However, the following environment variables can be used to customize its behavior:

*   `QUANTUMCALC_SIMULATOR`: Specifies the default simulation backend. Possible values are `dense`, `sparse`, or `qiskit`. The default value is `dense`. This can also be specified in the Python script directly.
*   `QUANTUMCALC_NOISE_LEVEL`: Sets the default noise level for simulations. This value should be a float between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.0 (no noise). This can also be specified in the Python script directly.

## Usage

Example 1: Building and simulating a simple quantum circuit:

`import quantumcalc as qc`

`# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits`

`circuit = qc.QuantumCircuit(2)`

`# Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit`

`circuit.h(0)`

`# Apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as control and the second qubit as target`

`circuit.cx(0, 1)`

`# Measure the qubits`

`circuit.measure_all()`

`# Simulate the circuit and print the results`

`results = circuit.simulate()`

`print(results)`

Example 2: Using the sparse matrix simulator:

`import quantumcalc as qc`

`# Create a quantum circuit`

`circuit = qc.QuantumCircuit(3)`

`circuit.h(0)`

`circuit.cx(0, 1)`

`# Simulate with the sparse simulator`

`results = circuit.simulate(backend='sparse')`

`print(results)`
